# Reporting Process

### Submitting a report {#submitting-a-report}

Once the partner has entered all the data associated with each indicator report in the progress report, along with other information like partner contribution/challenges/way forward and any attachment they would like to send as part of the report, they can then submit the progress report. At this point the partner will not be able to edit any data associated with this report.

The email of the person submitting the report should be checked against the email of the authorized officer assigned to the PCA that is connected to that PD. If the emails are the same, then the report is submitted. If the emails are different, then there is a pop up that ask the user to select which Authorized Officer is the user submitting the report on behalf of. The user can choose only 1 and submit.

#### Final Report Submission {#final-report-submission}

The final report is generated then right after the end of the final reporting period and the PD has reached the "**ended**" status.

When submitting a final report the partner will be given slightly different options for overall status.

Once a final report has been generated, no change to the PD reporting periods should be allowed \(in PMP\) and hence the final report is really always the final one for the PD.

**Edge case** \(to be handled in a future release\): Super-users in PMP can make changes that might not be in alignment with above restrictions. If that were to happen then a manual administrative data fix might be required on the PRP side as well.

### Acceptance of a report {#acceptance-of-a-report}

The UNICEF PO is responsible for acceptance of a progress reports that are submitted \(There is no workflow following the submission by the IP to UNICEF and Cluster\). This happens in the PMP system. The PO can also **send the report back with a note**, in which case the partner should get an email informing them that should review the note and re-submit the report \(data in the report becomes editable once its been sent back\). In that case the partner can log back in, make any changes recommended and resubmit the report back to UNICEF.

### Reporting Restrictions {#reporting-restrictions}

Partner must be able to report \(enter data and submit\) on Active, Ended, Suspended & Terminated PD’s. The only reports partners should not be able to report on are signed and closed

PRP must generate reports for the partners when the PD is in active status. \(as we don’t allow partners to report on signed PD’s and we don’t show draft PD’s in PRP\).

To add in case a PD is terminated or suspended in middle of the agreement then the final report must be moved to the end / suspended date of the contract and the other pending reports for the rest of the months must no longer be due.

If PD is not active then in PMP we cannot "send back the report" even.
