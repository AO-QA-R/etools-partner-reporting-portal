# Data Model

The high-level conceptual data model for the product is below. Its designed in a way to support the requirements of generic reporting against indicators, but also specific reporting requirements that may come along.

{% hint style="info" %}
The indicators \(Reportables in the data model\) can be associated via a generic foreign key to any other model, keeping it generic and expandable in the future
{% endhint %}

### Handling reporting on indicators by multiple reporting entities

See [Reporting to UNICEF](../product-end-user-documentation/cluster-reporting/reporting-on-results/reporting-to-unicef.md).

TBD: more details via Silin and update data model above.
